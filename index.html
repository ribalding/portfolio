              <h3>About Me</h3>
            </div>
              <p>I was born and raised in Syracuse, NY.  I graduated from Liverpool High School in 2007, after which I moved to Buffalo, NY to attend Buffalo State College.
                In 2012, I graduated with my BA in Philosophy and in 2015 I relocated to Portland, OR.  My other main interest is music.  I have been playing guitar, bass and drums for over ten years and have been in several groups.
                I also create music using computer software like FL Studios and Ableton and produce under the name <strong>Dirty Hands</strong>.  I believe the attraction to the logical components of philosophy, combined with my inclination toward creative pursuits like music are the two motivations which make coding appealing to me.</p>
